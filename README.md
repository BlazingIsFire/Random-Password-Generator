# Random Password Generator (Python)

This is a simple random password generator that I have created using Python. It uses the modules of **string** and **random**. To use, simply run the file "passwordgenerator.py" in an command prompt and it will ask you for a numeric value. Once you enter a value, a password will be generated.

Hope you enjoy!
